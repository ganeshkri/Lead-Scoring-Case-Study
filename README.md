#Lead Scoring Case study-Logistic Regression Model
This Repository contains the code and files related to the Logistic Regression Model built for a Lead scoring case study. 

##Problem Statement:
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. This company get leads to its website from several websites and search engines like Google.The typical conversion rate is now 30%.The company requires you to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.The target lead conversion rate is to be around 80%.

##Steps Involved in Model Built:
Below are the steps involved in the Model building process.

- Importing Libraries and Loading Data
- Inspecting the DataFrame
- Data Cleaning
- EDA
- Dummy Variables Creation
- Test Train split

- Making Predictions using the final Model
- Model Evaluation
- Plotting the ROC Curve
- Prediction on test set
- Precision and Recall
